Hello there! For the past decade I have used the dark arts to conjure up high-quality websites and frontend experiences. My knowledge in creating scalable web projects and commitment to web accessibility has equipped me with the spells necessary to excel in designing and building data architectures and pipelines with exceptional data quality and integrity. My graphic design background will allow me to craft data visualizations that are compelling and illuminate complex datasets with clarity. This new journey combines my technical expertise, creative vision, and problem-solving skills to empower decisions and uncover impactful insights and solutions. ðŸ”®
