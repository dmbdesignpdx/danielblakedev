Hello there! For over a decade I have used the dark arts to conjure up high-quality websites and 
frontend experiences; and in doing so, grew a new passion for ensuring strong backend 
foundations and a connection to data. My journey started way back in the days of Flash; 
building my first web projects with ActionScript. The realms of accessing information has 
drastically changed since then with data shaping how we interact with the world. Providing 
access to information will always be the force that drives me. ðŸ”®
