Hello there! For almost a decade I have used the dark arts to conjure up high-quality websites and frontend experiences; and in doing so, grew a new passion for ensuring strong backend foundations and a connection to data. My journey started way back in the days of Flash; building my first web project with ActionScript. The realm of the web has drastically changed since then and this craft allows me to continuously learn and explore new possibilities. I believe in a user-first approach to build accessible, responsive, and fast websites. ðŸ”®
